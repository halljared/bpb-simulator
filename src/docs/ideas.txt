items create artifacts when they activate
artifacts are then passed around to be modified before they resolve

Piercing arrow problem:
  buff gives * weapons: 'on hit: remove X block'
  this type of attribute produces its own artifacts
  it could subscribe to hit events from the weapon 

See: Attribute Collection.
  There's different ways to tackle attributes. Initial thought is to
  frame every attribute as unique and only allow modifications. This
  makes the presence of most attributes somewhat mandatory since they
  would need to exist before they can be modified. You could do lazy
  creation of attributes but do they stop existing when they are no longer
  modified? Gloves of Power being the most problematic example currently:
  grants "gain X armor on hit" and can easily be applied multiple times.
